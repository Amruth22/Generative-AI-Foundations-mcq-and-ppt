## Slide 6: Mathematical Foundations
### **Probability Distributions**

| **Aspect** | **Generative Models** | **Discriminative Models** |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **What they learn** | P(X, Y) - Joint Distribution | P(Y\|X) - Conditional Distribution |
| **Focus** | P(X) - How data is distributed | P(Y\|X) - How to predict Y given X |
| **Approach** | Model the complete data generation process | Model only the decision boundary |

#### **Key Insight:**
- **Generative:** "How is this data created?"
- **Discriminative:** "How do I classify this data?"

## Slide 8: Discriminative AI - How It Works
### **The Classification Process**

```
Training Phase:
Input Data + Labels → Learn Boundary P(Y|X) → Classification Model

Prediction Phase:
New Input → Trained Model → Class Prediction
```

#### **Examples of What It Learns:**
- 🏷️ **Decision boundaries** between classes
- 📊 **Feature importance** for classification
- 🎯 **Optimal separation** of different categories

|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Create new data | Classify existing data |
| **Learning Target** | P(X, Y) or P(X) | P(Y\|X) |
| **Output** | New data samples | Class labels/probabilities |
| **Data Requirements** | More training data needed | Less training data needed |
| **Computational Cost** | Higher (more complex) | Lower (more efficient) |
| **Use Cases** | Content creation, data augmentation | Classification, prediction |
